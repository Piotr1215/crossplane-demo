## Demo

### Scenario

The demo scenario highlights Crossplane's composite functionality. Using composites helps abstract away infrastructure complexity from developers by moving it into a Platform Team.

The scenario flow:

- install crossplane on a local cluster
- deploy AWS and azure providers
- expose composites to the developers
- developers deploy and manage the life-cycle of dev/test clusters in AZURE and AWS
-

TODO:

- [ ] Should be moved to Infrastructure sub group once it's created.
